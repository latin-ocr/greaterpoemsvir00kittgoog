1. ro] lee AEneicl. 67

5. et bello, i.e. his sufferings did not end with his arrival, but con·
tinued in the subsequent wars (§ 258, s, G. 384, 11.ι ; H. 425, i.).-‹1um
conderet (ξ 328; G. 573, 574; H. 519, 2), till he could found: the
subjunctive here shows the act as the purpose of the gods, for although
they thwarted him to please Juno, yet they meant in the end that he should
succeed.

6. Latio, into Lunum (dative after inferret, ξ 228, but cf. 225, b,
H. 385, 4). Latium is the undulating plain between the Sabine mountains
and the sea: its inhabitants Latini, and its language Latin. ’ The name is
assumed to be derived from an ancient king, Latinus: in fact, it was just
the other way ; the name of the king is purely imaginary: he is a so·
called eponynrous hero, ie. one invented to account for the name. -unde,
i.e. from all the soregoing-Latinum: this is not strictly accurate, as
that race already existed. But in Virgil’s time it had long been incorpo-
rated with Rome, and many great families traced their descent from it:
he therefore represents the whole as if sprung from Troy.

7. Albani putres: Alba Longa was the head of the Latin league of
thirty confederate towns. When conquered by Rome, its leading families,
Albani patres, were said to have been transferred to Rome, which now be·
came chief of the confederacy. The terrn refers here, in general, to the
great senatorial families.

8. Musa, etc. (see note, v. 1) : Virgil follows the regular epic method
in referring all the plot to the gods. —quo nurnine laeso. Of this much·
vexed passage the best meaning seems tube, what purpose [of Juno] hav·
ing been thworted? Τ11ε answer would then be in vv. 12-22, as that to
quid dolens is in vv. 23-28. The two causes, then, are that AEneas hin-
dered her plaus, and was also personally hateful to her. This view agrees
best also with the etymology of numen, the will or power of the gods as
expressed by their nod (nuo); and is not inconsistent with the meaning of
laedere (11.λυμαίνομαιίη Xen. Anah. i. 3, 16).

9. quidve dolens, poined ot what .· dolero, to feel pain, is transitive
also in prose. See § 237, b ; G. 329, s.¹; H. 371, tii. —tot volvero
casus to run the round osso many chancer. “Τ11ο misfortunes are re·
garded as a destined circle which AEneas goes through.” The infinitive
follows impulerit by a poetic use (ξ 331, g ; G. 546, n.¹; H. 535, ἰν.),
and has for its subject virum.

10. pietate (ξ 248; G. 4035 H. 416) : this word means his filial de-
votion in the rescue of his father, as well as his piety towards the gods.
The gods could, however, pursue with vengeance even a pious man, either
because under the power of Fate he thwarted their purposes, or because
his ancestors had committed crimes, as was the case with the descendants
