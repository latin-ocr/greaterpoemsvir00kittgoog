Notes.

THE AENEID.

Boou 1.

Fron the beginning to v. 34 is introductory, giving the subject and the
occasion (see argument 111 text). The real action begins with Juno’s 501110-
quy. It will add greatly to the understanding and interest of the AEneid to
consult the corresponding passages in Homer, which are frequently cited,
with references to Bryant’s translation (Ery). In general, the first six books
have a certain correspondence with the Odyssey, and the last six with the
Iliad; but the direct allusions to the Iliad are much more frequent in

the former portion.

introductory verses—The lines, Illo ego, etc, printed before the
AEneid‚ are by some editors included in the text, but the general opinion
is that they are a spurious addition.

Verre 1. Arma vir-umquaie. the conflicts attending the settlement
in Italy, and the adventures 01 the hero who led the expedition. Compare
the opening 01 the Iliad and of the Odyssey. For construction see§ 237:
G. 331 ; H. 371, i. 2).-pr1mus venit, who first carne (§ 191; G.
324, R.⁰): the settlement of Antenor (i. 242, Liv. i. 1) is not reckoned‚ as
North Italy (Cisalpine Gaul) was not until 42 tac. considered as belonging
to Italy proper. By some it is made: ofold.

ἢ 2. Itanum, to Italy: acc. 01 end of motion (ξ 258; G.410; H. 380, 3).

—tato (ξ 245 ; G. 407 ; H. 416) profugus, driven by sate, ie. not
merely an adventurer: the verbal adjective here: a perfect participle. —-
Lavlnia (the last l has the sound 01 y, as in pinion, and is not counted
in scanning), i.e. the western coast of Italy, where is the town of Lavinium,
assumed to be named for Lavinia, the Italian bride of AEneas. The read·
ing of some editorS, Laevina, is less approved.

3. 1110, etc, tlte man fang tossed: there is no verb to be supplied, but
the pronoun is in a kind of apposition with ouh-terrm, alto (locative
abl. § 258, f ; G. 384, R.²; H. 425, ΝΡ), by land and on the deep.

4. vl, the immediate cause or instrument, while ob. Iram is more re·

let him escape from her mind. Iuno (= Iovino, feminine form of Iovis) is
the goddess of the slry, represented by the poet as filled with a vindictive and
relentless hatred of Troy, which does not stop at the destruction of the
city, but pursues AEneas into his distant exile.
