PASTORAL POEMS.

*¹000—

lirrsn ten short pleces, the earliest authentia works ol Virgil, treet ol
pastoral subjects, the loves and songs o! herdsmen (βουκόλοι), and hence
are called Bucoucs, They were published under the title ot &meurs
(teloyot, selections). In form they are chiefly imitatione, osten transla-
tions, of the IDYLs (eldbllro, or picture poems) oi Theocritus and the
other Greek pastoral poets; but the soenes often belong to Italy, the
occasions to the history οῖ’ the time, and the incidents to the poet’s own
lise.

In a highly artificial period, such as that under the Empire, or in the
lull alter greaticonvulsions like those which marked the downtall of the
Roman Republic, the simplicity and quiet of rustic life have osten, by a
kind of affectation, been admired and celebrated in song, by persons very
sar removed from a rustic condition. These first poetic essays-though
in the highest degree artificial, and imitations of far superior originals-
have, by their persection of form, delicacy ol treatment, and charm of
diction, taken rank, in the judgment ot every age since, as models in their
kind

ECLOGUE 1.

IN this poem Virgil sings his gratitude to Angustus for restoring the
farm of which he had been robbed to reward the soldiery of the triumvirs
(see Life). The poet himself, however, is only ‹limly shadowed in the
person of Tityrus, aherdsman, iu dialogue with another, Meliboeus, who
represents Virgil’s less fortunate neighbors. The whole scene with its
incidents, thus removed to the mythical domain of pastoral poetry, gives a
peculiar delicacy to the praise.

MELIBOEUS. TITYRUS.

ITYRE, tu patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi
silvestrem¹ tenui Musam meditaris avena;
nos patriae lines et dulcia linquimus arva:
