There are, however, many peculiarities ot' form and construction.
The most frequent of these-besides Greek lorrns ol inflection-
are: r. the omission ol prepositions, especially with the locutive
ablative3 2. the free use of the dative in preference to other con·
structions3 3. the genitive (of specification) with adjectives3 4. the
constant use of the infinitive (instead of the gerund ora clause)
to express purpose and result. In general, we may say that more
is demanded oftlte cases than the more highly developed construction
of prose will admit. Some of these forms and constructions seem to
be archaic, retained bya traditional poetic dialect, as, for example,
the omission ol prepositions.* Some os thern are directly copied
from the Greek, as many cases of synecdochical accusative. The
greatest number, however, are due to both these causes combined,
as the infinitive construetions.

The main difficulty in reading poetry is to determine exactly what
image or idea was in the poet's mind, t'or it is to be remembered
that poetry requires a more vivid and picturesque use of words than
prose. The ieamer should therefore not be satisfied with a loose
conception or translation, but should try to see and express precisely
the meaning ol the poet's words.
