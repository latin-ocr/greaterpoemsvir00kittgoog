6 Notes. [Bucot.

at ease .· properly flexible, but often used as the reverse of braced or
strained to toil.

5. formosam, slmpely .· i.e. her charms are coupled with her name
in the song. The ancients especially prized beauty of form and tall stat·
ure (cf. Anab. iii. 2, 25).—resonare, reZcho: the effect of song in the
groves. — doces: the conti-ast is heightened by the peaccful and happy
occupatiori os Tityrus, singing the charms of his love. — Amaryllida

favorite Greek name, meaning braym-ests.

6. Meliboee, a Greek name, meaning com-herti. - deus, a god .· as we
should say, guardian-angel. The gods os the ancient mythology were so
numerous, and so near to mankind, that the name osten has about the same
dignity as that of saints in modern times, The reference is to AugustuS, who
was, however, not regularly deified until after his death in ΑΛ). ι4ς hence
probably the apologetic tone of namque, etc. — otia, freedom from care,
the reverse of neg-otium, business or trouble. The plural seems to be
= the blessings of ease,· but the plural is osten used by poets for metrical
reasons only (ς 75, c; H. 130, 3).

7. namque (very rare in prose, more commonly etenim), for, I tell
you: the enclitic que connects it with the preceding wordS‚ while nam
introduces the reason, the whole expression regularly implying that no argu-
ment is necessary, as with our ‘⁸ you see,’' “ you know,’' —illez Tityrus uses
the emphatic pronoun as if to say,
“ He, my great patron,'’ though
Meliboeus does not know to whom
he refers (ς 102, ὂς Η. 450, 4).—
mihi, in my regard (dat. of refer-
ence, ς 235) ·-’ mins (see §3472 Ῐ 3
H. 577, 3).- aram, altar, for
lesser sacrifices (see Fig. 3): the
altare, high altar sor burnt offer-
ings (Ecl. v. 66), was dedicated
only to the higher deities, but this
distinction is not always observed.

8. tener, young. — nostris ε
Tityrus speaks as the steward of
his master’s sarm—imbuet, shall

stain (with its blood). —agnus‚ the offering of a humble estate: the
richer might sacrifice a calf, and the poorer a pig, a fowl, or some fruit.

9. errare, to stray, or grau at large. See 5 331, ις G. 546, R.;
