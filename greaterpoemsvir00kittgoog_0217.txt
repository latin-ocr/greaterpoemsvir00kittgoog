Ecr.1.] Pastorol Poems. 11

46. pascito, ete: here Virgil drops the allegory: he went to Rome
chiefly to beg his freedom; and the answer he is supposed to get is to keep
his farm, -seed your cotos and breed your bullocks as before (compare note
v. 41).—submlttitc‚ properly, to roise sor tlte purpose of breeding, ap-
parently a technical word os graziers and cattle-breeders (see Georg. iii. 73,
159, and Lexicon). ¹

47. tun rura manebunt, tlte fields will continue yoerr. Tityrus is
here no longer the poor slave herdsman, but the yeoman landowner, repre·
senting the poet himself.

48. lapis omnia, etc, however the bore stone ond marslt with muddy
bulrusi may cover all tlte metzing-ground This description οἱ acountry
alternately marshy and gravelly will be recognized by any one who has
travelled in the territory os Mantua. The idea is: though itis nota very
good farm, yet it is good enough and a blessed fortune compared with ours.
By some, the passage from quamvis is connected less naturally with
non insueta, etc, below, and some have referred it to the neighboring
farms

50. non insueta, etc, no strange pasturege will distreus your sickly
flock, as is the case with curs—gravis fetas, the wealding cattle, which
have lately dropped their young (compare line 15).

51· mala, hanefa-contagia: plural, meaning many cases oi the
disease, as osten in Latin (ξ 75, c; H. 130, 2).

. 52. flumina nota, fhmiliar streoms .· ie. the course oi the “smooth-
sliding Mincius,” which flows by Mantua.

53. fontis sacros, sacred fhunts, “ srom the pretty superstition which
assigned a divinity to every source and springs-(riguis opacum, cool
eliade (see note on tegmine, o. 1).

54. hinc tibi, etc, on tiis side, as ever, the hedge on tlte nee'grhboring
roudway, whose willowflower is sed on by Hyblaeon beer, shall often, wito
its sos! rohispering, eoin you sleep. In this perplexed sentence, quae scm·
per means os it olrooys loos done: florem is acc. ot' specificatiou (ξ 240,
c; G. 332; H. 378) by a common Greek construction, aiter depasta,
sed repom salicti is the contracted form ot' collecti, willon-grove:
susurro, tlte whispering of leaves mingled with the hum of bees ; limito,
strictly, the line run by public snrveyors (agrimensores), dividing off the
land sor purposes os cultivation. (See Georg. i. 126. The term was also
extended to the municipio, and cases os other public boundaries, where the
strict formalities of the Roman system were not followed. lt always means
a public boundary, while finiris used of private estates. Τὴε limes was not
a line, but an open tract, 8, 12, 20, or 40 feet wide, serving as a roadway.
The saepes here described was therefore, strictly, a roodride hage.)-
