735. coetum (con, eo), guthering festive as well as politicaL—
celebrate, strong, or attend in large numbers; hence used in nearly the
same signification as in our English word derived from it. — faventes,
strictly, “speaking words of good omen '² ; hence, with expressions of joy,

Phoenician divinities Melkarth and Astarte, which latter is sometimes iden·

Aratus had also sung in this manner of astronomy ; so Parmenides, Xeno·
