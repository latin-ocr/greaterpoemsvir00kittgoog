11.19o.] Τ he AEneid. 125

177. Pergama, the citadei of Troy.

178. omino: Virgil here transfers a Roman custom to the Homeric
Greeks. All enterprises were undertaken by the direction of the gods,
who were supposed to dwell in the city, and were consulted by auspices
before setting out; and if the event was unsuccessful‚ the auspices must be
taken again in the city, and the whole be begun anew. The term for
this was repetere auspicia, of which repetere ostrina is here a variation. -
Argis, from Argos—repetant (5 336; G. 653; H. 524). -numern
the favoring presence of the gods, as shown by renewed favorable auspices.

179. pelago (ξ 258,g), by sen—curvis cerinis (ξ 248; G. 4035
H. 420), in ibe crooked sitlos ,· cf. ll. ii, 297.

180. quod, in that (ξ 333, a; H. 540, iv). The antecedent or main
clause is parant, etc.

182. digerit omina, interprets the omem, ie. those referred to in
vv. 171-175. The word omen (root in os, oro) properly means any
casually spoken word which serves as a prognostic of the future. lt is
used here, as very commonly, for visible signs, which were properly ostenta,
portenta, prodigio.

183. pro Palladio, in lieu ostiu Palladium ,¹ pro numine, in pro·
pitiatr'on of the offended divinity. The goddess is however identified with
her image the Palladium, hence pro can be used with both, though not in
precisely the same sense.

184 trisse, 31me (n its effect).

185. The gist of the idea is in immensum molem. They were to
make it huge so as to keep it where it would protect them, and not the
TroJans. —tamern i.e. though it was in lieu of the Palladium, yet it was
to be of no service to the Trojans.

186. coelo (5 225, b; G. 344, s.⁸; H. 384, 4), to the sky.

187. recipi and duci are branches of the same general idea; neu
introduces a different one. Sinon at once accounts for the size of the
horse, and hints at the disposui of it which he desires.

188. antiqua, ie. just as formerly under the protection of the Pal·
ladium. - religione: this word implies both piety (religious veneration),
the sanctity which calls it forth, and the object which possesses that sanctity. -
Here it seems to he used with a confused notion of ali, chiefly the last.

189. donum Minervae (obj. gen), gast to Minerva-violasset,
ind. disc. for future perfect (ξ 286, lt.; G. 5163 H. 525, 2).

190. quod dl . . . convertant, may the gods turn the omen agnitis!
himself. The ancients had a curicus notion that the anger of the gods
must be satisfied, but that it might by prayers be turned upon something
eise, -a notion which seems* to be the foundation, in very ancient orientai
