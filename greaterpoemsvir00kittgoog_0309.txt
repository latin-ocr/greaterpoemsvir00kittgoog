lation These four are: rising just inbre the sun, setting just oster it
(112112221), rising just aster sunset and setting just before sunrise (anony-
cal). It was the fourth phenomenon, setting just before suurise, in the

stellation its ill-repnte. It may be that Virgil here had no distinct astro-
nomical appearance in his mind, but only associated Orion with bad
