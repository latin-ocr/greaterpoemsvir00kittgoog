98 Notos. [AErssm.

444. uaris, spirited, an omen of their energy and warlike disposition.
The adjective is, as often in poetry, a descriptive epithet, not meaning a
padicular individual, but expressing a general characteristic, as we should
say “the cruel tiger.” —slc‚ ie. by this omen.

445. facilem victu, easily subsisting: the supine (ξ 3033 G. 4373
H. 547) is to be taken from vivo. Thus the horse is represented as an
omen both of prosperity in peace and success in war. Compare Anchises·
interpretation in iii. 540.

447. numine divae, i.e. the presence of the goddess herself, meaning
that she loved to dwell and show her power there.

448. llmlna, liudoldo—surgebant, crowneol (lit. rose on the
steps).- gradibus (ξ 258,s; G. 384, R.²; H.425,w.³).—nexaeque . . .
trabes, croso-beatus cased willa dronae. The abundance of metal-work
shows the great costliness and splendor of the structure. — -que is, ehded
before uere, in next line (§ 359, c, R.; H. 608, NP).

449. foribus,sbldr'rrg·doors.

450. hoo primum, etc, the temple offers the first hint of Dido‘s in·
terest in his fortunes (see the description below).

453. dum lustrat, os lte suroeys (ξ 276, e ; G. 220, n.; Η. 467, 4).
This verb is used originally of the priest's going about in purification:
hence of other forms of surrey or passing under review. -eingulau the
details. ,

454. quae malt, notice how easily the verb miratur takes two
different constructions, -an objectanda clause (ξ 3343 G. 469 y 11. 529)
—a common thing in Latin and Greek.

455. artificum manus, tlte artists’ skill; operum laborem, tle
loborious work. There is nothing to indicate that the temple was un-
linished.— inter se, a doubtful expression, perhaps, comparing llrem wirte
each other. The reading of Ribbeck, intrans, would show that he was
drawn by admiration into the interior of the temple.

456. videt, sees: probably painted in the vestibule or colonnade‚ as
Fabius Pictor had painted the temple of Solus in Rome ; but some suppose
them to have been in sculpture on the pediment. These pictures could
have no significance for the Phoenicians. Virgil here transfers to them the
arts and customs of the Greeks and Romans.

458. saevum ambobus: enraged against Agamemnon, as wellas
hostile to Troy.
