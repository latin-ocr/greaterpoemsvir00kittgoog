H 147. levibuS, light, skimming the surface.—rotls (§ 248 ; G. 403;
. 420).

148. veluti, just as: introducing the first and one of the most cele·
brated of Virgil's similes. 'l'he ferocity of a mob and the power of elo-
quence were things very familiar to the Romam. ‚ Hence the simile is
proper, though generally the less vivid should be compared with the more
vivid. — magno in populo t the greater the crowd the more striking the
effect. —saepe belongs properly to the whole idea, and so is equivalent to
as often happens.

mean or obscure (lit. of no recognizable standing: ill-gnoson).

150. iam, see note, v. 133. —faces‚ fire-brands .· Rome, being at

enea—meritis, services (to the state).-—si quem belong with virum.

152. conspexere, plur. because here the individuals are thought of,

attention.

153. regit . . . anlmos, sways their minds by words (addressed to
their reason); pectora mulcet, calms their passion (whose seat is in the

of an animal, and so of soothing the blind passion οἱ the crowd.

154· fragor, crash of the breakers (frango).

the horses. (See Fig. 39.)

157. quae proxima =
the nearest, sc. erant.

158. vertuntur, turn .-
used in the reflexive or
‘⁴ middle ” sense, which is
expressed in English by the
active form, and in Latin
more commonly by the pas·
sive (ξ 111, N.¹; G. 210; ς ‘-
H. 465). But the active '²³⁵³' ·'-'‘
is also common in the same sense after Cicero's time ς compare v. 104.
