21. ipsae, of themselves.

22. noo . . . leones: this and similar images have been thought to be
imitated from the Hebrew prophets, particularly lsaiah xi. 6: “the wolf
shall dwell with the lamb,” etc. But if Virgil had known this passage, he
would hardly have missed the words so exquisitely fit to his purpose, “a
little child shall lead them.'’ He appears to copy here the established
imagery of the golden age (compare Hesiod, Works dfe, 118, 23⁶3.
Theocr. xi. ¹23 Hor. Od. iii. 4,17; Epod. xn‘. 49). The idea agrees

seems to have been a proverb of impossibility. (Ablative of separation

30. roscida mella: it seems to have bee'n believed that honey fell in
the form of dew, and was gathered by bees. This makes clearer the notion
that the cicada fed on dew. — sudabunt, disti! (here followed by a cog·
nate accusative, ξ 2383 G. 331 ; H. 371, i. 2). Wild honey found in hol·
low trees might possibly be thought to be exuded from the tree itself.

31. pauca: notice the emphasis3 a few though only a few. -prtseae
