893. geminae portae: this description of the horn and ivory gates
is taken from the words of Penelope to Odysseus (Od. xix. 562-5673 Bry.
678). ln the Greek, the sulfilment or non-iuliilment oi the dream is hinted
by a play of words (κέρας, κραίνω; ἐλέφας, έλεφαὶρομαι). Tbere is no such
significance in Latin ; and Virgil appears to have adopted the imagery as
partos the Homeric tradition, and also to hint at another passage from the ’
land os dreams than that by which AEneas had entered. By those who r
think this book a symbolio exhibition os certain mysteries, the legendos
the Getes, with the dismissal of AEneas stom the ivory one, is considered a
warning that the language may not be taken literally‚ or understood except
by the initiated. - fertur, is reported (citing the above legend).
