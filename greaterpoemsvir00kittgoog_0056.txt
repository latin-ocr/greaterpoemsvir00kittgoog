34 rae Epic ofAEmas.

The subject 01 the AEneid is the destruction 01 Troy, the seven years’
wandering oi AEneas, and his settlement in Italy, with me wars raised
against him by the native princes, all ol which events finally resulted in
the establishment oi the city 01 Rome. Theline 01 tradition followed by
Virgil was somewhat as follows: 1113 city 01 Troy had ior many ages been
under the special care 01 the gods Its walls had been built by Poseidon
(Neptune) 3ηά Apollo, and were impregnable, except under the condi·
tions strictly prescribed hythe edict 01 the gods. Prince Ganymede had
been borne by an eagle to Olympus to serve as cnpbearer at the celestial
banquets. Tithonus, brother 01 Priam, was the husband 01 Eos (Aurora).
Priam 3ηά Anchises had both in their youth been renowned ior beauty.

But the royal house had fallen into the oriental vices 01 luxury and
treachery. Laomedon, father 01 Priam, had incensed the hero Hercules
by withholding the sacred horses, the promised reward for the rescne 01
his daughter, and was slain by the hand 01 Telamon. The royal palace
had become a seraglio, where Priam’s finy sons, by his numerous wives,

shepherd on the mountain, he was visited by the three great goddesses-
Hera (June), Pallas, 3ηά Aphrodite-to award ffle prize 01 beauty
among them, the golden apple 01 discord: His reward ior bestowiug the
prize on Venus should be the most beautiful 01 living women ior his
bride. ‘lhis was Helen, wile 01 Menelaus, king 01 Sparta, daughter 01
Zeus (Jupiter) 3ηά Leda; 3ηά 3 wrong to her was to be revenged hyali
the heroes and chieis 01 Greeee, who had been her suitors. Paris visited
Sparta, “with flower-embroidered raiment and bright in gold,” 3ηά car·

ried her away to Troy. Hence the famous ten years’ siege, and the de·
structiou 01 the sacred city.

About the tale 01 Troy had gathered a vast body 01 legendary adventure,
contained in the ‘⁶ Cyclie Poets,'’ the sestal Odes, the attic Tragedies, and
above all in the great Homerie poems, the Iuno and Onrssnr. The Iliad
