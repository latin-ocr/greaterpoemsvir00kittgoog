682. levis apex, a light tip (of flame): properly any sbarp point, as
oi a hill; but especially the pointed top oi the cap worn by the starum
⁴ (the priest ol a special divinity), and the Salii, or dancing priests ol Mars.
It was no doubt these sacred caps that Virgil had in mind; though the
phrase strictly means only the appearance ol a light dame on the child's
head. As in the case ol Servius Tullius, it signifies his future royalty.

684. lambere, play arouml. - pasci, i.e. may, as if it were an ani·
mal grazing.

· construction, as usual, marks the haste and excitement ol the occasion.)

686. excutere, snatch away,· properly, striking it off with the hand.
-- sanctos, because it was a divine omen.

690. hoo tantum: supply precor or the like.

691. deiude, i.e. aster having looked upon us and judged our case.-
firme, confirm by some lresh omen. A second omen oi similar meaning
would, in the practice of augury, confirm the first ; one ol contrary meaning

694. stella, i.e. of course,a shooting·star or meteor, a phenomenon¹

always regarded with superstition by the ancisum—fecem ducens,
drawing a trail of light, like a firebrand (fax) waved in the hand.

695. illam, the star: notice how the Latin, by the skillul use'ot' pro·
noune, avoids repetition ; in English we cannot secure the emphasis here
by using a pronouu‚ as the Latin does

696. ldaea silva, marking the place ol gathering. ΤΙιε light, says
Servius signified the future glory ol the house3 the fiery trail, that some
would stay behind; the length ol the path, their long voyage; the fur·
row (sulcus), that it must be by sea; and the sulphur-smoke, the death
of AEneas, or the war in ltaly. Probably the Trojans did not see so much
in it. -elaram‚ still arighi.

697. limite, path, see note, Ecl. i. 54 (abl. ol manner).
