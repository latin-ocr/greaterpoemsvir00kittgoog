identified those nymphs with the Greciau Muses, with whom they had in
reality very little in common. ⁸

Here begins the real Arnoebaean, though the preceding has been some·
what like it. Notice that the second poet generally follows in a strain
similar to the first, but always extends or intensifies the idea if he can (com-

· pare Ecl. vii). The sudden changes of subject, especially towards the

end, are characteristic, and show the zeal of the contestants,·-the chal·
lenger always secking some new theme, in the hope of baffling his
adversary.

60. ab lover compare Theoer. xvii. 1, Aratus, Phoen. 2. -Μιιεαο,
an invocation (taken by Ribbeck and Heyue as gen). —lovfs omnia
plena: this sort of pantheism had come to be the prevailing style of
thought among philosophers (see the Hymn of Cleanthes to Zeus): it is
frequently found in Virgil (see Georg. iv. 220-227). For case see 5 218, a;
G· 371³ H· 399, i· 3·

⁶3· laur-l, hyacinthus: these plants were the-delight of Apollo ; the

(ld. x. 162). For scanning see ξ 359, e; G. 714, ιιι-11111114 (ξ 148, d;
H. 304, i. 3). But such adverbs are hardly ever used except by the poets.

64. mulo perro, hirs me with an opple .· apples were gifts of love, and

66. at mlhl, ie. but my flame (Amyntas) is not so coy.

67. Delia, perhaps Menalcas's mate (contubernalis): perhaps better ’

The wood-pigeon is sacred to Venus.
