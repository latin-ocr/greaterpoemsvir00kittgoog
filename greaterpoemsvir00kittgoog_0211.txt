recubans (root cun in -cumbo)‚ reclining (bachim). The pic·
ture, as often, is much more vivid than we should ordinarily make it in
English-tegmine (root in tego), stade. Notice in all Latin and Greek
,poetry that, on account ‘of the climate, the coolness of shade and water are
especial objects of deiight; while hardibood is more often shown by the
endurance oi heat thau of coln—fagi, beeck. This tree is often men·
tioned as growing on the mountain slopes of northern Italy, where herds
were driven in summer. [The same root (unae) is found in the Greek
φηγός, the Latin fagus and the English beccis also (since its bark was
used as wiking-material) in book. ‘ihe word is probably connected with
the meaning aar (φαγεῖν) from its edible nuta]

2. silvestrem, woodlund = pastoral (compare iv. 3). — tenui avena,
on the thiu reed, which made a delicate sort of pipe or whistle (abl. instr,
§ 2485 H. 414, 4, the usual construction of names of musical instruments).
Several reeds of different lengths were fastened together with wax, making
a rude musical instrument now called Pandean Piper (see Fig. 2), -first
made, it was said, by the god Pan from the reed into which the nymph
Syrinx had been transformed (hence the plant Syringa, and syringe).
The hollow reed has given its name to the vibrating
tongue of wood or metal which takes its piace in modern
instruments. One cannot help feeling that the idea of
the humble nature of pastoral poetry is also impiied in
tenui. - Musam, the Muse, or goddess (patron saint)
oi song, used for song itself. The ancients constantly · ’
identified their divinities with the thing that was their ’ ,i ι
care. So Ceres, grain. -meditaris‚ practise (μελετᾶν).

3. nos, emphatic by being expressed at all; here, also, hy its position
and repetition (ξ 194, a, H. 446). - patriae fines (compare v. 68), our'
native bounds .· the patria consisting merely of the native village, or per·
haps farm. Local attachments are commonly strong in proportion to men's
ignorance of other places. [ibe acc. plur. form in es, in place of is, was
coming into use in Virgil's time. The two forms were probably used in·
differently by him (§ 583 H. 62)*].-1tnqu1mus, are leaving (present
of continued action). - arva (root in aro), tilledsields.

4. fugimus, a stronger word than linquimus, denoting the hurry and
confusion of flight, here opposed to the easy repose of Tityrus. -lentus,

Fro. 2.
