The effect is to us, and must have been to the ancients, some·
what monotonous. But it is relieved by the variety ο1 dactyls and
spondees, and also by the interruption ο1 ieet at the end of words
(Casum). One of these interruptions at the end oi some principal
word, or at some pause in the sense (in the third foot, or less corn-
monly, the fourth), is more marked than the rest, and is called The
Coesura (see Grammar, ἓ 362, b). This main caesura is often a great
help to the sense, and must be observed as an important part ο1 the
structure of the verse. It may be remarked that the verses most
agreeable to the ear are those in which dactyls are n'rore numerous,
or alternate with spondees3 while in the opposite mse -especially is
the last foot but one is a spondee (⁶⁶ Spondaic verse ”) —a slow
and labored movement is given to the verse, which is osten very
expressive (see Ecl. iv. 493 AEn. ii. 463-466).

lt is not known with certainty how elided syllables were treated
in reading. lt is probable, however, that the vowels and diphthongs
were so slurred over as to make them equivalent to y and w, and
that when m was cut off it leit a nasal sound, which was still audible
enough to give a nasal character to the syllable. Where, as in Ecl.
i. 13, elision interferes with the main caesura, the line may be read
without any main caesura, or the sense may be sacrificed to the form
of the verse.

This metre is not native to the Latin language, but is borrowed
from the Greek. Hence all poetry written in it has more or less an
artificial character, and requires a conventional poetic diction. The
rules of the metre exclude very many words: all words, for example,
in which a single short syllable comes between two long ones (as in
all the cases ο1 aequltan longitudo, and similar words, all except
the nom. sing. of insila, unless the last syllable can be removed
by elision3 and many forms ο1 verbinflection, as fe'cdrant), or where

more than two short syllables come together (as in frilrlmus, ltin!- .

ru, and in gladius, nom, acc., and voc). The necessities of the
metre osten give rise to elisions which hurt the flow of the verse (as
in Ecl. ii. 2 5), or to artificial arrangements (as in Ecl. i. 14, 70).
The Syntax of Virgil, in general, is much easier and simpler than
that ο1 most prose writers, and there are few difficulties oi construc-
tion except where the ellipsis oi words produces obscurity. The
quantity of syllables, as shown by the metre, is often an easy gulde
to the construction: asin Ecl. i. 38, the long a in sua at once con·
