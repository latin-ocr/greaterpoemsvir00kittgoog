Ecnocus V.

'I’uls Eclogue is divided‚ ss are iii and rii, between two singem but
here the Amoebaean strain or alternate formis not preserved. ΤΙιε first
finishes before the second begins. For various suppositions about this
Eclogue see Sellar's Virgil, p. 138.

1. eur non: here the more common qutn.-b0n1‚skilled, followed
by infin· (t 273. d ι G· 424, κὴ H· 5³3, 3)·

2. levis: notice the quantity of the l, showing the acc. plural.

3. corylis, why not sit ltere among tlte elms mingled with hazels : best
considered as dative (ξ 248, a, R.; G. 346, it.²; H. 385, 3), though the
ablative also is used in this construction-consedimus: imitation of the
Greek aorist, with τί οὺς many editions have oonsldlmus, the regular
Latin form with quln3 it is equivalent to an exhortation in either case.

4. mator, the elder.-ttbt (§ ²273 G. 3455 H. 385).-parero
(f 2705 H· 538)·

5. slve . . . slve, whether we come beneatlr the quivering skadmvs
stirred by the zephyrs, or into the grotta rather. -zephyris (ξ 2553 G.
409; H·431)·-umbras‚ sees 152, c; H· 435, n}

6. ut sparsit: the question may be considered as direct, or the in-
dicative may be referred to an earlier usage (ξ 334, d ; G. 469, n.¹; H.
529)-

7. silvestris labrusca, tlte wild vine that runs to wood, and has
clusters only here and there (roris). These words hint modestly his
preference for the grotto.

8. tibi certat (ς 229, c; G. 344, n.³; H. 385, 4), ie. attempts to
rival you.

9. quidsi oernessa playful disparagement of his rival: suppose lte
were to rival Phoebus (with a hint at the fate of Marsyas, whom Apollo first
vanquished in music and then flayed alive). Τιιε conclusion (ξ 307, b,
G. 5955 H. 509) is here only implied. -oanendo (ξ 301; G. 4323 H.
54², ivl·

11. Alconlst this name occurs in Ovid, Met. xiii. 683, as that of a
famous sculptor—iurgia Codri, quarrels os Codrus (cf. vii. 22, 26).
ΤῙιε idea is, “whether you have love, or praise, or quarrels ; in fact, any
pastoral subject to sing of.”

13· immo hoec experiar, nay, rather, [will try these, ie. none of
the above-mentioned themes.

14· carrulna, see ξ 200, b.—dosorlpsl, compare x. 53.-modu-
lans alterna notavi, I set them lo music, noting alternately (the pipe
and voice). -alterna (ξ 191).
