:hd AEuuss begins the tale: the Greeks, discouraged, had withdrawu to
¹ Tenedos, leaving the wooden horse, in which chosen warriors were hidden
(vv. 1-39). Laocoon in vain protests against receiving it within the walls:
meanwhile Sinon, pretending to have fied from the Greeks, is received in
confidence by Priam, whom he persuades that the horse is a sacred offering
to Minerva (40-198). Laocoon and his sons are destroyed by two mon·
strous serpents: the horse is brought with rejoiciug into the city, and at
night Sinon sets free the Grecian chiefs (199-267). The ghost of Hector
appears to AEneas‚ and warns him to flee. 'lhe city is seen in flames:
AEneas and his companions take arms (268-369). Victorious encounter
with a party of Greeks: a disastrous conflict follows, and they come to
Priam’s palace (370·45²)· Defence and storming of the palace: the fate
of Priam, slain by Pyrrhus, while vainly attemptiug to protect his son
(4535 58). AEneas returns to his own house — first meeting Helen, whom
Venus warns him not to slay — and beholds in a vision the divinities who
preside at the destruction of Troy (5 59-633). Anchises at first refuses to
fly, but is encouraged hya divine omen (634-704). AEneas‚ bearing his

confused by a sudden alarm, loses Creiisa on the way (yos—751). He
seeks her in vain at his palace, which is now filled with the armed enemy ;
but she meets him in a vision and comforts him by assurance of her own
deliverancefrom hostile hands. At dawn, he finds a numerous company

escaped from the city, with whom he seeks the shelter of Mount lda

Infandum, regina, iubes renovare dolorem,
Troianas ut opes et lamentabile regnum
eruerint Danai3 quaeque ipse misenimavidi‚

‘l et quorum pars magna lui. Quis talia fando
Myrmidonum Dolopumve aut duri miles Ulixi
temperet a lacrimis? Et iam nox umida caelo
praecipitat, suadentque cadentia sidera somnos.

Sed si tantus amor casus cognoscere nostros
et breviter Troiae supremum audire laborem,
quamquam animus meminisse horret, luctuque refugit,
