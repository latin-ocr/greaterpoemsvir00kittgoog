Hera (identified with Juno) was worshipped with especial veneration at
Argos, as the great goddess of the Dorian tace. Here this city is put for
all Greece.—pr1ma= as chief (before all others ; compare primus, v. 2).

grounds of Juno's enmity.

irarum, motives ofwrath (irarum, plural, referring to its many manifes-
tations, § 75, c; G. 195, R.⁵; H. 130, 2).

slighted beauty, i.e. of the disparagement shown to het beauty (ξ 292, a;
G. 667 ; Η. 549, N.²). We should expect iniuria to Be in apposition with
iudicium, because it means the same thing, but the Latin often prefers to
separate two such ideaS, and connect the words with et or que.
