“THE structure of this poem is taken from the latter part of Theocr,
ldyl i, the dying Daphnis supplying the model for Gallus, whose despair,
’ however, does not in our poet bring him to death. Vir-gil is supposed to
narrate the story in a song as he is tending his goats, and in rising to go
home for the evening he gracefully intimates that he is closing the volume
- of pastoral poetry.’' The scenery (purely conventional) is in Arcadia.
Milton’s Lycidas may be compared with profit.

1. Arethusat conventionally, the nymph of pastoral verse. The
Arethusa is a fresh fountain which rises in the little island Ortygia, the
heart of Syracuse. To account for it, the fable was invented of a nymph
in Elis, who, being pursued by the river-god Alpheus,‚was changed into a
brook, which disappeared in the earth, and after flowing beneath the sea
reappeared in this sacred isle of Diana (Ovid, Met. v. 572-641; AEn. iii.
694). The allusion is of course to Sicily, the country of Theocritus.

2. quae legat, such that Lycoris may read: “the antithesis to pauca:
though few, they must be such as may attract even her scornfnl eye.''—
legat, subJ. of purpose (ξ 3173 G. 632; H. 497, i.; cf. note on iv. 33).

3. neget, dubitative subj. (ξ 268; G. 251; H. referred to 485).

4. sle tibi (dat. after intermisceat, ξ 228; G. 346; H. 386):
compare ix. 30, and note, and Comus, 924, 925: -

“ May thy brimmed waves for this
Their full tribute never miss.”

oum subterlabere, when thou skalt glide beneath. In Moschus (Id. vii),
the Alpheus is represented, “taught by Love, the mischief-making boy, to
dive,” as flowing beneath the sea to visit his love. Here Arethusa appears,
perhaps according to the more common form of the myth, as flying from
his pursuit under the sea to Sicily, where she arrived without having her
current mixed with the salt water. The myth is here regarded as a con·
tinuing phenomenon. Virgil prays her “to assist his tale of love, as she
would wish to be undisturbed in her passage.”
