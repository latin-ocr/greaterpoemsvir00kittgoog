PASTORAL POEMS.

Ecroouss 1.

THIS Eclogue is founded on historical facts; namely, the ejection of
Virgil from his sarm and his recovery of it through the favor of Augustus.
(See Life.) Tityrus represents the poet himself, and Meliboeus his less
fortunate neighbors. Though the subject is treated in the conventional
pastoral style, yet the poem gives a lively picture of the distress caused by
the assignment of land 'to the veterans of the civil war.

The scene represents Tityrus, late in a sunny aftern00n‚ reclining at
the roadside by his cottage near Mantua, with Amaryllis busy near⁰ by, in
household cares, while Meliboeus passes, driving his goats from the farm
of which he has been dispossessed by the soldiers. An ancient (200
to 400 A.D.) conception of the scene is given in Fig. 1, from a Vatican
manuscript.
