BOOK III.-Trrn annnsnurc or AErrnrs.

Tus exiles sail in early summer, and arrive at Thrace, but are alnmed
by the prodigy of a bleeding thicket over Polydorus’s grave (π. 1-68). At
Delos they consult Apollo, and (misunderstanding his oracle) settle in
Crete, whence they are driven by a pestilence (69-146). AEnees is warned
in a vision that Italy is the destined land: they set sail, but are overtaken
by a storm (147-208)‹ Seelring shelter at the Strophades, they are driven
thence by the Harpies, and follow the coast as iar as Epirus (noys-293).
Here they lind Helenus and Andromache, who joyfully receive them in
hospitality (294-35 5). The prophecy oi Helenus: they depart, lnden with
gists (356-505). They hail the coast of Italy, and proceed till they near
Sicily and the residence of the Cyclops: the spectacle of Mount AEtna (506
587). Here they rescue one os the companions ot' Ulysses. The mon·
ster Polyphemus is seen approaching the shore: his eries summon his com·

partious (588-681). Retracing their course, to avoid Scylla and Charybdis,
they land at the port of Drepanum: the death of Anchises (682·718).

OSTQUAM res Asiae Priamique evertere gentem
immeritam visum Superis, ceciditque superbum
Ilium, et omnis humo sumat Neptunia Troia,
diversa exsilia et desertas quaerere terras
auguriis agimur divom, classemque sub ipsa
Antandro et Phrygiae molimur montibus Idae,—
incerti, quo fata ferant, ubi sistere detur,—
contralrimusque viros. Vix prima inceperat aestas, ,
et pater Anchises dare fatis vela iubebat;
litora curn patriae lacrimans portusque relinquo
et campos, ubi Troia fuit: feror exsul in altum
curn sociis natoque.Penatibus et magnis dis.

Terra procul vastis colitur Mavortia campis,
Thraces arant, scri quondam regnata Lycurgo,
hospitium antiquum Troiae sociique Penates
dum Fortuna fuit. Feror huc, et litore curvo
moenia prima loco, fatis ingressus iniquis,
Aeneadasque meo nomen de nomine fingo.
