783. septem arces, the seven hetghts (suatimontium) ,· the name was
first given to the Palatine‚ with its spurs and those of the adjoining Esqui-
line3 it was afterwards extended to the larger group of the “seven bilis,''
with which at first it had nothing to do.

784. felix prole virum, hlessed with a progeny os heroes, as Cybele,
“mother of the gods.” Her name Berecyntia is derived from Mt. Bere·

through the fields once ruled by Lalian Saturn,· see Ecl. iv. 6, and Intro·

794. super Garamantas, beyond the Garamantes, a tribe oi interior
Africa, which sent an embassy to Augustus. How this struck the Roman
imagination is seen in the following verses. —lndosz the reference is to

thirty years before from Crassus.
