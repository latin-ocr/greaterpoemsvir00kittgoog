= 381. bls denis: the distributive is used, because ten are counted each
time (ξ 95, e; G. 95, n.1; H. 174, 2). - conscendi aequor, l cle'mbed
thesea, because thesea seems to rise as it recedes (cf. v. 365), or simply
embarked upon-navibus (ξ 248; G. 391, R.’; H. 420).

382. data, spoken at various times (see ii. 771; iii. 94, 15 ).

384. lpse, opposed to the ships. - ignotus (ln-gnotus), although
he has just said fama notus: his person is unknown, though his

driven from Asia (Troy) and Europe (Thrace), and is still forbidden to
reach Italy.

385. plura querentem, beginning to complain further (conative
pres, ξ 276, b ; G. 224), compare Ecl. i. 29, and note-nec, and not
(qualifying passa). Notice that the Latin likes to combine negative and
connective in one word.

G. 636, referred by H. 10 517).

390. reduces: acommon use of two accusatives in apposition
after verbs of knowing‚ saying, etc. (ξ 186, c; G. 334; H. 373). We
may supply csse, but the construction is older than the infinitive with
the accusative, and is no doubt the origin of the indirect discourse
construction.

392. nl flustra, etc, i.e. unlessI am quite ignorant of the seleuce.—
augurlum (avis, and an uncertain verb-root): she relieves his anxiety
without betraying herself as a goddess. Τ110 flight of birds was the most

cio). -vanb salsely (ξ 191), not necessarily implying any conscious de-
ceit on the part of the parents.

393 etseq. This passage has given more trouble than seems neces-
sary. The swans are represented in two groups, one alighting (terras
capere), and the other looking dowu on the place where the first has
alighted (terras captas). They are again described, the former as re·
duces, the latter in cinxere, etc, in 398. The ships correspond to these
two groups: those already in (portum tenet), to the former, and those
just coming in (2261102112), 10 the latter.

394. lapsa, rwooping down on the swans, which flew low like other
water-fowl. - aperto caelo, in tlte open sky, where they were exposed, as
