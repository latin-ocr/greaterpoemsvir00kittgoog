THE main action ol this book, the visit to the world os Shades, is ex·
panded from the narratives of Ulyssesin the eleventh book of the Odyssey.
But while Ulysses, in a region vaguely indicated as at the ends of the earth,
beyond the Ocean stream, simply offers sacrifice aud digs a trench about
which the ghosts crowd eager to taste the victim’s blood, and so hold con·
verse with him; we have in Virgil a definite locality, and a vast under·
ground realm os which the entrance is marked by the sulphur springs and
caverna near the bay of Naples, with its well-defined regions ot' the tor·
mented and the blessed, according to the more developed though philo·
sophie and skeptic opinion of his time. Some passages have been thought
to hint at the initiatory rites 'of certain mysteries, to which Virgil had him-
self been admitted, much ol the philosophy is Stoic pantheism; and the
theory oi the vision appears to include the Pythagorean doctrine os me·
tempsychosis. Compare Ovid, Met. xv. 1-487. Ι

1. Slo fatur: these lines, in some editions, are added to Book V. -
nnmttnt habenae, i.e. sets all sail (lit, gives loose reins to the fleet).

2. Euboicis: the colonization from Euboeawas of a later date than
the supposed time of AEneas. - Cumarum: Cumae was the oldest Greek
settlement in Italy. It was situated on the coast, a lew miles west of
Naples, where its remains are still to be seen. In its foundation Chalcis
ol Euboea was united with Cyme in Asia Minor, -hence the name Cumoez
the assigned date is lac. 105o; compare with the succeeding description
that in iii. 441-460.

3. obvertunt proras: the vessels were brought up to land stern on
so as to set sail again more easily. ⁰

4. litora (ξ 228, a; H. 386, 2).

5. praetexunt, ie. a line 'of sterns is seen along the shore; ci, v. 3. -·
