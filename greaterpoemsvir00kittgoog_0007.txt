NOTE.

...ο-.-

THE text of this edition follows Ribbeck in the main. adhering,
however, to the received reading where he seems to be not fully

supported by his own apparatus criticus. Variations are indioeted
in the margin.

It is hoped that the many woodcuts, all taken from ancient
objects of art, will serve to illustrate the poet's conception better
than annotations alone could do. The grammatical references
are to Allen and Greenough's Latin Grarnrnar¹ and to those oi
Prof. Gildersleeve and Prof. Harkness. The Botanical Indexis
derived chiefly from F ee's Flore dc Virgn'le, contained in Iemaire's
ιι Bibliotheca ciassrea munau

All the material that was available has been retained from

Allen and Greenough's Virgil, including, among other things, the
Life of virgil, the Summaries os the separate books, and the List
of Plants.

The second volume will contain the remainder of the AEneid‚
with the Georgics.
