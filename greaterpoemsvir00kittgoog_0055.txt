THE EPIC OF AENEAS.

nnn-”0-

Tm: AEneid has stood for many centories as a model of Epic Poetry.
Properly speaking, however, an Epic consists oi a body of immemorial
tradition, which has taken form in the mind and langoage oi a people 3
and which, while the traditione were yet living and believed iu, has been
worked up in a· single poem, or group of poema, whose antiquity and
national character have made them, in some sense, sacred books. 'lhia
is what the poenis of Homer were to the Greeks, the Mahabharata and
Ramayana to the Hindoos, and the Niehelungen to the Germana.

The AEneid is an Epic in a very different sense-in what, lor the
sake of distinction, may he called the literary sense. Thongh it has the
foundation of traditione, and all the divine machinery ol the true Epic,

yet the traditions are no longer living; the divine machinery is no
longer a matter ol belief. The traditione are dug out by antiquarian

research. The machineryis manusactured to order, as it were, in a mod·
ern workshop. Many of the incidents are labored invention, while the
whole iswritten with a definite purpose, as a work oi art. These things
put itin a widely different class· from the Iliad and Odyssey, which serve ’
in some sense as its models, and with which it has heen oftenest compared.

Still the purpose for which it was written distinguishes it clearly {rom
,ῑ other artificial Epics and raisesit more nearly to the level ot the Epic
proper. 1t was not written merely as a work ol' art, nor from a casual
poetic inspiration. Itis the produci of a patriotic national sentiment and
a belief in the divine origin and destinyoi the Roman State. It is said
that the poem was written at the request oi Augustus. But it 'a no mere
flattery of a reigning house. The supremacy of the Julian iamssy was
identified in the mind oi the poet and his readers with the culmination of
the Roman State in victory and peace, the predestined consummation of
ages os vicissitudes and struggles.
