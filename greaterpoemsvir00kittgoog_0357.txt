ιι. 765] TieAEneid. 151

735. mihi (ξ 229; G. 344, ι’, H. 385, 2).-nrale amioum, un·
friendly, ct. note, v. 23.—nesoio quod=a weak aliquod (ξ 334, e; G.
469, nir H· 529. 5)-

7 36. confusam eripuit mentem, robbed me osmy presence ostreind
in my confusion ,¹ strictly, took away my senses by confusing them (a pro·
leptic use of the participle, as in iii. 236).

737. noto, familiar,¹ regione, directior (abstract of rogo). Some
by·path had to be followed to avoid capture.

738. misero, best taken as dative (ξ 229; G. 344, 1133 H. 385, 2),
οι may be ablative with fato. The passage has given infinite trouble to
commentators. The nrost generally received opinion is that there are
three alternatives: 1st‚vthat she stopped simply; ad, that⁶she lost the way;
and 3d, that she sat down to rest. ln this view rato erepta is taken as
true in either case and belonging with them all. But if these latter words
are referred primarily to the case which really occurred (cf. non sine
nurnine, o. 777), and interpreted as referring to a divine interposition by
which Creiisa stopped behind, some difficulty seems removed. The doubt
then in AEneas’ mind would he, whether she stopped without any human
agency‚ as she might well do, being fato erepta, or whether the gods
used some ordinary human means.

Translate: ΑΙι, wretched me, my eoe'se Crerssisa, either stopped behind,
torn from me ty sate, or strayed from tlte path, or tired out sat daron to
rest, it is uncertain olrici.

739. substitit: for the mood compare ξ 334, d; G. 469, a) The
question, however. may possibly be regarded as direct.

741. nec prius . . .quam, nor did I look back . . . until. This want
of care, though strange to us, is in accordance with the manners of the
ancients. AEneas’ chief care would be for Iulus. Of course in following
the legend there isa necessity ior getting rid of Creissa.

743. venimus, see 5 327, (ς G. 576 ; H. 5ao.--oolleotis omni-
bus (ablative absolute, ξ 255), wien all were gathereri -una, she
alone.

744. fefellit, was missed by. Notice that the word is transitive in
Latin.

745. deorumque (to avoid the recurrence of sound there would be
in deumque): the enclitic queis elided bysynaplreia (ξ 359, e; G. 738,
lt.; H. 608, N.⁵).— amens, in my madness.

749. fulgentibus ornile, no longer seeking to avoid notice. His
armor would have been brought by some one of the servants. -olngor
(5 111, N.¹; H. 465).

750. stat, my purpose is fixed (ξ 270, b ; H. 538).
