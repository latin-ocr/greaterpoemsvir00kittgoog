RMA virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit
litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto
vi superum saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram;
multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem, 5
inferretque deos Latio, genus unde Latinum,
Albanique patres, atque altae moenia Romae.

Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso,
quidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus
insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores
impulerit. Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?

Uuss antiqua fuit, Tyrii tenuere coloni,

Karthago, Italiam contra Tiberinaque longe
ostia, dives opum studiisque asperrima belli3
quam Iuno fertur terris magis omnibns unam
posthabita coluisse Sam03 hic illius arma,

hic currus fuit3 hoc regnum dea gentibus esse,
,Ξί qua fata sinant, iam tum tenditque fovetque.
Progeniem sed enirn Troiano a sanguine duci
