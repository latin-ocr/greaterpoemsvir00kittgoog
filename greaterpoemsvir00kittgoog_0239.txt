15. deinde iubeto, then bid Amyntas try (if you dare), see 5 269, d ;
G. 262; H. 487, 2: Mopsus is a little piqued at the hint of Amyntas’s

H· 535, ii-)-

16. saux, sallunoa: the leaves os willow are in shape and color
similar to olive, though the plant is comparatively worthless ; and the herb
saliunca, though fragrant, cannot be woven into garlands like the rose.

are chosen as resembling the valuable oneS.

18. iudicio (§ 2533 G. 3983 H. referred to 416.)

24. pastos boveS, the pastured cattle (after feeding·time).

“ watery death ” of Daphnis.

26. graminis herbam, a blade of grass.
27. Poenos leoneS, lions of Barbary. “The wild mountains and
